## Category 1: Behavior & Psychology (15 Topics)

### Topic 1: The 21-Day Habit Myth
**Insight**: 21 days is wrong. Research shows 66 days is closer to reality (Lally et al., 2010).
**Template**: Stat Bomb (T1) + Science Explainer (T4)
**Hook**: Hook 2 (Contradictory Truth) — "Everything you know about building habits is based on a lie."
**Key data**: 21 vs 66 days. Only 4% of resolutions survive past 90 days.
**Platform**: TikTok (Stat Bomb), IG Reel (Science Explainer extended)
**Messaging pillar**: Energy Management (systems over willpower)

### Topic 2: The Zeigarnik Effect
**Insight**: Unfinished goals torment you — your brain keeps processing incomplete tasks, draining mental energy.
**Template**: Science Explainer (T4)
**Hook**: Hook 4 (You Call-Out) — "That thing you keep thinking about at 2AM? There's a name for it."
**Key data**: Zeigarnik's 1927 study — 90% better recall for interrupted tasks.
**Platform**: TikTok primary
**Messaging pillar**: Energy Management (open loops drain energy)

### Topic 3: Social Facilitation
**Insight**: You perform better when watched. Being observed by others increases performance on well-learned tasks (Zajonc, 1965).
**Template**: Science Explainer (T4) + Comparison (T5)
**Hook**: Hook 1 (Confronting Stat) — "You are 65% more likely to complete a task if someone is watching."
**Key data**: 65% improvement with social observation. Group exercise adherence vs solo: 42% higher.
**Platform**: IG Reel (Comparison), TikTok (Science Explainer)
**Messaging pillar**: Community Accountability

### Topic 4: Loss Aversion
**Insight**: Missing a streak hurts more than gaining one feels good. Losses are psychologically 2x more powerful than gains (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979).
**Template**: Loop Narrative (T2)
**Hook**: Hook 3 (Visual Timeline) — Day 1 excited → Day 14 streak → Day 15 break → devastation
**Key data**: 2:1 loss-to-gain ratio. Streak loss triggers cortisol spike.
**Platform**: IG Reel primary (save-worthy emotional narrative)
**Messaging pillar**: Both (energy cost of loss + accountability as protection)

### Topic 5: Identity-Based Habits
**Insight**: Outcome-based goals ("lose 10kg") fail. Identity-based habits ("I am someone who exercises") stick. (James Clear's core thesis)
**Template**: Comparison (T5) + Loop Narrative (T2)
**Hook**: Hook 2 (Contradictory Truth) — "Goal-setting is the reason you're failing."
**Key data**: Identity-shift behavior change: 3x retention vs outcome-based.
**Platform**: IG Reel (Comparison), TikTok (abbreviated)
**Messaging pillar**: Energy Management (identity = system, not willpower)

### Topic 6: Habit Stacking
**Insight**: Linking new habits to existing ones (implementation intentions) doubles success rate.
**Template**: Science Explainer (T4)
**Hook**: Hook 5 (Data Story) — "One change. 2x the success rate. Here's what it is."
**Key data**: Milne et al. (2002) — 91% exercise compliance with implementation intentions vs 38% control.
**Platform**: TikTok primary (quick science hit)
**Messaging pillar**: Energy Management

### Topic 7: Why Gym Resolutions Fail Every February
**Insight**: 80% of gym memberships go unused after February. The drop-off is structural, not motivational.
**Template**: Stat Bomb (T1) + Data Journey (T3)
**Hook**: Hook 1 (Confronting Stat) — "80% of gym memberships are unused by February 14th."
**Key data**: 80% unused. Average gym visit drops from 4.2x/week (Jan) to 0.8x/week (Mar).
**Platform**: TikTok (Stat Bomb), IG (Data Journey showing weekly decline)
**Messaging pillar**: Both (energy depletion + accountability as solution)

### Topic 8: Implementation Intentions

**Messaging pillar**: Energy Management

### Topic 9: Temptation Bundling
**Insight**: Pairing an obligation with a reward increases compliance (Milkman et al., 2014).
**Template**: Science Explainer (T4)
**Hook**: Hook 4 (You Call-Out) — "You already know the hack. You just haven't named it."
**Key data**: Milkman study — 51% increase in gym visits with temptation bundling.
**Platform**: TikTok primary
**Messaging pillar**: Energy Management

### Topic 10: Why Motivation Is Neurologically Unreliable
**Insight**: Motivation is dopamine-dependent and depletes with decision fatigue. It's a feeling, not a resource.
**Template**: Loop Narrative (T2) + Stat Bomb (T1)
**Hook**: Hook 2 (Contradictory Truth) — "Motivation is not a personality trait. It's a chemical reaction that runs out."
**Key data**: Dopamine baseline drops 50% after sustained effort (Baumeister, 2012). Decision fatigue study.
**Platform**: TikTok (Stat Bomb), IG (Loop Narrative — the "Monday motivation → Wednesday crash" arc)
**Messaging pillar**: Energy Management (energy is the bottleneck)

### Topic 11: The Fresh Start Effect
**Insight**: Mondays, January 1st, birthdays all spike goal-setting because of temporal landmarks (Dai, Milkman & Riis, 2014).
**Template**: Data Journey (T3) + Stat Bomb (T1)
**Hook**: Hook 5 (Data Story) — "Google searches for 'start a new habit' spike 145% on Mondays."
**Key data**: 145% Monday spike. January: 3x search volume vs November.
**Platform**: IG Reel (Data Journey), TikTok (Stat Bomb)
**Messaging pillar**: Both

**Key data**: Average underestimation: 40% (Buehler et al., 1994).
**Platform**: IG Reel primary (emotional narrative)
**Messaging pillar**: Energy Management (plan around energy, not ambition)

### Topic 14: Social Norms Shape Behaviour
**Insight**: We unconsciously match the behavior of our peer group — for better or worse (Cialdini, 2006).
**Template**: Comparison (T5) + Science Explainer (T4)
**Hook**: Hook 1 (Confronting Stat) — "You are the average of the 5 habits of the people closest to you."
**Key data**: Christakis & Fowler (2007) — obesity spreads through social networks (57% increase if a friend becomes obese).
**Platform**: IG Reel (Comparison — solo vs community), TikTok (Science Explainer)
**Messaging pillar**: Community Accountability

### Topic 15: Commitment Devices
**Insight**: Pre-committing against future failure works because it removes the decision point (Schelling, 1960).
**Template**: Science Explainer (T4) + Stat Bomb (T1)
**Hook**: Hook 2 (Contradictory Truth) — "The best way to build a habit is to remove your ability to quit."
**Key data**: StickK.com studies — 72% success rate with financial commitment devices vs 30% without.
**Platform**: TikTok primary
**Messaging pillar**: Both (commitment device = accountability mechanism)
