# Entropy Lifestyle - Brand Motion Identity Guide

## Brand Overview

**Entropy** is a lifestyle operating system that helps high performers run their days around managed energy - not motivation - so time becomes usable, habits become sustainable, and progress becomes measurable. It's not a habit tracker or 30-day challenge app. It's the architecture of how you live.

**Core Problem**: High performers don't fail because they're lazy. They fail because their energy is unstable. The real bottleneck is energy management, not time management.

**Core Promise**: Managed energy -> usable time -> sustainable lifestyle -> measurable progress

**Pillars**: Time as Currency, Energy as North Star, Systems over Willpower, Measurable Proof, Lifelong Operating System

**Aesthetic**: Minimal, calm, premium, high whitespace, thin-line icons, geometric shapes, soft gradients. Apple product marketing meets WHOOP data viz meets Notion minimalism. Scientific calmness - biometrics, rhythms, waveforms. Wellness as identity.

**Target**: High-performance executives, founders, athletes, creators who treat their lifestyle as a system

## Core Motion Philosophy

### The Entropy Principle
The transformation from chaos to order IS the brand's visual identity. Neither pure chaos nor pure order is compelling - the motion BETWEEN them is where the brand lives.

- **High entropy** = chaos, noise, scattered elements, visual disorder
- **Low entropy** = structure, clarity, organized elements, visual order
- **The transition** = the brand moment (the most interesting part)

### Four Motion Pillars

1. **Transformation**: Particles assemble from scattered states into structured protocols
2. **Optimization**: Data-driven animation - numbers count up, metrics fill, progress builds
3. **Personal Evolution**: Morphing - one state transforms into another
4. **Community**: Convergence - multiple elements coming together, ripple effects

## Signature Visual Metaphors

### Particle Assembly/Disassembly (Primary)
Scattered particles converge into recognizable forms (logos, text, data).
- Start with random positions, use attraction forces to pull into structure
- Timing: 0.8-1.5s for assembly moment
- Add secondary motion: glow, trails, size variation
- Reverse (disassembly) for exits, dissolution, habit breaking

### Glitch-to-Clean (Secondary)
Noise effects, chromatic aberration, blur that resolves to clean.
- Layer noise with decreasing intensity
- RGB channel split that converges
- Displacement map that smooths out
- Quick, dramatic transition (300-500ms)

### Organic-to-Structured (Tertiary)
Fluid/smoke forms that crystallize into geometric shapes.
- Start fluid simulation, reveal clean geometry beneath
- Cross-dissolve with turbulent displacement
- Blur reduction from high (organic) to zero (structured)

### Noise-to-Signal (Data Moments)
Static/grain resolves into clear data/message.
- Fractal noise at high opacity, animate to zero
- Color desaturation (noise) to full color (signal)
- Audio complement: white noise resolving to clear tone

## Logo Animation System

### Full Ceremony (1.2s) - Video intros, brand intros
- 0-0.4s: Particles scatter in random positions
- 0.4-0.7s: Hold + momentary glitch/noise
- 0.7-1.2s: Particles rapidly assemble into wordmark

### Quick Snap (0.5s) - App transitions, section changes
- Abbreviated assembly, particles snap to position with ease-out

### Micro (0.3s) - In-content branding, watermarks
- Subtle pulse/materialization

### Reverse (1.5s) - Outros, closings
- Wordmark disassembles into scattered particles that fade

## Motion Timing System — KINETIC (Updated per Content Bible)

The Content Bible demands: Fast. Crisp. Forward-moving. Never slow.
Entrances under 0.3s. Static holds max 1.5s. Hard cuts for fact delivery.

| Motion Type | Duration | Easing |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| Entrance animation | 300ms | ease-out (kinetic spring) |
| Standard transition | 300ms | hard cut or fast crossfade |
| Data reveal | 800ms | custom count-up |
| Micro-interaction | 150-200ms | sharp ease-out |
| Page transition | 300ms | hard cut (default) |
| Pivot transition | 500ms | ease-in-out (the ONE slow moment) |
| Brand intro (full) | 1200ms | custom scatter/hold/assemble |
| Brand intro (quick) | 500ms | ease-out |
| Max static hold | 1500ms | add secondary animation during holds |
| Error/glitch | 300ms | linear + random displacement |

**Note**: The ONE exception to kinetic pacing is the narrative pivot — the moment where the content shifts from problem to solution. This gets a smooth 500ms crossfade. Everything else uses hard cuts.

## Hook Formulas (First 3 Seconds)

### Protocol Reveal
Glitched/scattered data points -> rapid assembly into clean score -> "Here's the protocol"

### Before/After
Split screen: chaotic low scores (red) vs structured high scores (green). "Day 1 vs Day 90"

### Community
Counter: "12,847 people tried this protocol" with animated increment, monospaced digits

### Transformation
Particles in chaos -> snap to order (0.5s) -> wordmark -> "Your morning is broken. Here's why."

### Data
Single large number counting up (sleep score 0->94), monospaced, neon glow on dark, then: "The protocol that did this:"

### Controversy
Bold text: "8 hours of sleep is ruining your recovery." Slight glitch on "ruining."

## Interaction Motion Language

### Tap = particle burst that quickly reassembles (150ms)
### Swipe = fluid trail that resolves into next screen
### Hold = elements gently vibrate then lock into place
### Pull-to-refresh = particles scatter upward, rain down, reassemble
### Error = momentary glitch/displacement that resolves
### Loading = particles in gentle orbital motion, coalescing as content loads
### Protocol creation = each added step triggers micro-assembly animation

- **Tagline**: "Your lifestyle, redesigned"
- **Website**: entropylifestyle.com (always include in closing frames)
- **Brand Voice**: Direct, data-informed, transformative, never salesy

---

## Mobile-First Sizing Rules

### Text Sizing (Critical for Reels/Shorts at 1080x1920)
- **Hook numbers**: Fill 50-60% of screen width minimum (massive, unmissable)
- **Headlines**: Fill 70-85% of screen width, bold weight only
- **Body/Statement text**: Fill 80-90% of screen width, semibold minimum
- **Data labels** (sleep: 4.2h, etc.): Must be clearly readable at phone distance -- minimum 28px equivalent, prefer 36-44px
- **Chart labels/axes**: Minimum 24px equivalent, must be legible without squinting
- **CTA text**: Large enough to feel tappable, minimum 32px equivalent
- **Website URL**: Prominent, minimum 28px, always visible for 2+ seconds
- NEVER use tiny/subtle text in motion content -- if it's on screen, it must be readable at arm's length on a phone

### Transition Timing — KINETIC (Updated per Content Bible)
- Scene-to-scene transitions: hard cuts (default) or 300ms crossfade
- Element entrances: under 300ms (slide, scale, or fade with kinetic spring)
- Text reveals: one line at a time, kinetic entrance + brief hold before next
- Between statement sequences: 200ms pause (breathing room)
- Static holds: maximum 1.5 seconds (add secondary animation during holds)
- Final frame: hold 2 seconds minimum
- ONE slow transition per piece: the narrative pivot gets 500ms crossfade
- Everything else: fast, crisp, forward-moving
- KINETIC = ENERGISED. The motion reflects the energy of accountability.

### Strict Sequencing Rule -- NO CONCURRENT INDEPENDENT ANIMATIONS
When one element is animating (moving, transitioning, drawing), NO other independent
element should begin its animation until the first is FULLY COMPLETE and a pause has passed.
- Animation A completes → 400ms pause → Animation B begins
- This applies to: title moves + new element draws, chart draws + labels appear, etc.
- Exception: elements that are part of the SAME visual moment can overlap
  (e.g., staggered card entries = one moment, or a fill appearing as a line draws)
- NEVER start drawing/animating a new element while a previous element is still
  moving to its final position. The viewer's eye cannot track two moving things.

### Card/Panel Design
- NEVER use emojis in cards or UI elements
- Use geometric shapes, thin-line abstract icons, or brand-specific illustrations
- Cards should have animated entry (slide, fade, scale) with stagger
- Each card should have a visual accent element (colored border, icon, geometric shape)
- Prefer abstract/geometric representations over literal icons

### Equal-Weight Text Sequences
- When listing brand pillars or equal-importance statements, keep ALL lines the same size
- Only use decreasing size when there is genuine hierarchical difference
- Consistent size = equal importance = unified message

---

## Design Do's and Don'ts

### DO
- Always animate logo from entropy (particles) to order (assembled)
- Use monospaced fonts for ALL numbers/metrics/data
- Match animation energy to content tone
- Leave "breathing room" between text animations (200-300ms minimum between reveals)
- Design for mute viewing first (text overlays critical)
- Use grain overlay (10-15% opacity) for texture on dark sections
- Use off-white (#FAFAF8) canvas for primary backgrounds
- Make ALL text large enough to read at arm's length on mobile
- Include website (entropylifestyle.com) in closing frames
- Use ENTROPY in all caps for brand wordmarks
- Use sequential line-by-line reveals for multi-line text (never all at once)
- Allow 800ms+ for element position transitions

### DON'T
- Never use emojis in professional content (use geometric elements/thin-line icons)
- Never animate all text the same way (vary for hierarchy)
- Never use confetti, fireworks, or celebrations in data viz
- Never skip the first-3-second hook
- Never use light/thin font weights in motion (bold/semibold only)
- Never let text move too fast to read (min 1s on screen)
- Never use bouncy spring animations (use mechanical, damped Curves.easeOut)
- Never make text too small for mobile viewing
- Never rush transitions between scenes (minimum 600ms)
- Never use decreasing text sizes for equal-weight statements
