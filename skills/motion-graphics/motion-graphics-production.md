## Part 1: AI Video Prompt Engineering

### Universal Prompt Structure

```
[Shot type/Camera] + [Subject] + [Action] + [Setting] + [Lighting/Mood] + [Style/Quality] + [Camera Movement]
```

### The Four Pillars

1. **Subject** - Primary focus (what is in frame)
2. **Action** - What the subject does (the motion)
3. **Context** - Environment (where it happens)
4. **Style** - Visual aesthetic (lighting, color, mood, quality)

### Key Principles

- Be specific, not conceptual: "Volumetric rim light in cyan" NOT "amazing lighting"
- Describe, do not command: "Camera slowly pushes in on..." NOT "Make the camera zoom in"
- Start simple, iterate: Add one element at a time
- 50-100 words sweet spot (optimal for most platforms)
- Pair ONE camera move with ONE subject action
- Cinematic phrases like "35mm, slow push, golden hour, wet asphalt" outperform simpler descriptions by ~40%

## Part 2: Camera Movement Library

### Basic Movements

| Movement | Prompt Phrasing |
|----------|----------------|
| Pan L/R | "Camera pans slowly to the right, revealing..." |
| Tilt Up/Down | "Camera tilts up from ground to reveal sky" |
| Dolly In/Out | "Slow dolly in on the subject's face" |
| Truck L/R | "Camera trucks right alongside the walking figure" |
| Zoom In/Out | "Smooth optical zoom into the subject's eyes" |
| Static | "Static shot, fixed camera, locked off frame" |

### Advanced Movements

| Movement | Prompt Phrasing |
|----------|----------------|
| Orbit/Arc | "Camera orbits 180 degrees around the subject" |
| 360 Orbit | "Fast 360 orbit around the figure, eye level" |
| Crane Up/Down | "Crane up shot soaring above the cityscape" |
| Tracking | "Side tracking shot following the runner" |
| Leading | "Leading shot, camera moves backward as subject walks forward" |
| Dolly Zoom | "Dolly zoom creating vertigo-like depth compression" |
| Dutch Angle | "Dutch angle tilted 15 degrees, creating unease" |
| Whip Pan | "Whip pan left to right with directional motion blur" |
| Handheld | "Handheld camera, documentary-style, subtle shake" |

### Cinematic Specialty

| Movement | Prompt Phrasing |
|----------|----------------|
| FPV Drone | "FPV drone dive down the side of the building" |
| Drone Fly Over | "Aerial drone fly-over across the mountain range" |
| Epic Drone Reveal | "Camera rises and tilts down to show full landscape" |
| Bullet Time | "Bullet time spin around the frozen subject" |

### Pro Tips

- Use **active kinetic verbs**: glides, drifts, swirls, rushes, sweeps, crawls
- Specify speed: "slowly," "rapidly," "at moderate pace"
- Add lens details: "35mm," "anamorphic," "85mm portrait lens"

## Part 4: Style & Lighting Library

### Visual Styles

| Style | Key Descriptors |
|-------|----------------|
| Minimalist | "Clean, sparse, white space, uncluttered, geometric simplicity" |
| Neon/Cyberpunk | "Neon-lit, electric glow, high contrast, saturated pink and cyan" |

| Liquid/Fluid | "Flowing organic shapes, soft gradients, morphing, viscous" |
| Geometric | "Mathematical precision, sharp edges, polygonal, tessellated" |
| Editorial | "High contrast, controlled lighting, film grain, authoritative" |
| Futuristic | "Holographic, hologram overlays, chrome, quantum particles" |

### Lighting Types

**Studio Lighting:**
- Rim Light: "Crisp rim lighting separating subject from background"
- High-Key: "Bright and airy, minimal shadows"
- Low-Key: "Deep shadows, dramatic contrast"
- Chiaroscuro: "Bold light-shadow interplay"

**Atmospheric:**
- Volumetric: "Volumetric light rays cutting through atmospheric haze"
- Neon Glow: "Neon glow in electric blue casting colored shadows"
- Golden Hour: "Warm orange hues, long shadows"

### Color Control Techniques

1. **Named colors**: "Electric blue and deep charcoal palette"
2. **Light context**: "Warm peach highlights fading into cool teal shadows"
3. **Known palettes**: "Synthwave palette - neon pink, cyan, purple on dark"
4. **Hex codes**: "Palette centered on #00FF94 neon green and #121212 charcoal"

## Part 7: Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Duration Guidelines

| Duration | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| 3-5s | Single action, product shot, transition |
| 5-8s | Scene establishment, moderate action |
| 8-10s | Complex sequences, reveals |
| 10+s | Stitch shorter clips together instead |

### Platform Specs

| Platform | Aspect | Duration | Key |
|----------|--------|----------|-----|
| Instagram Reels | 9:16 | 15-30s | Text overlay for sound-off |
| Instagram Feed | 1:1 or 4:5 | Carousel | Swipe-through format |
| TikTok | 9:16 | 15-90s | Trending audio integration |
| YouTube Shorts | 9:16 | Under 60s | SEO descriptions |
| LinkedIn | 1:1 or 16:9 | 30-120s | Professional data stories |

### Negative Prompting by Platform

- **Kling, Wan 2.2**: Dedicated negative prompt field (no "no" prefix needed)
- **Runway Gen-4**: Does NOT support negative phrasing - describe only what SHOULD be present
- **Sora 2**: Describe what should happen, not what to avoid

### Common Negative Prompts
```
Technical: blurry, low resolution, pixelated, grainy, compression artifacts, watermark
Motion: morphing, warping, flickering, stuttering, jittering, frame tearing
Subject: deformed faces, extra fingers, extra limbs, distorted anatomy
Composition: cluttered background, cropped subject, oversaturated, overexposed
```

## Part 8: Mobile-First Production Rules

### Text Sizing (Critical for 1080x1920)

- **Hook numbers**: Fill 50-60% of screen width minimum
- **Headlines**: Fill 70-85% of screen width, bold weight only
- **Body text**: Fill 80-90% of screen width, semibold minimum
- **Data labels**: Minimum 28px, prefer 36-44px
- **Chart labels/axes**: Minimum 24px
- **CTA text**: Minimum 32px
- **Website URL**: Minimum 28px, visible for 2+ seconds
- NEVER use tiny/subtle text - must be readable at arm's length on phone

### Transition Timing (CRITICAL - NEVER RUSH)

- Scene-to-scene transitions: minimum 1000ms
- Element position changes: minimum 1000ms with ease-in-out
- Text reveals: one line at a time, 500ms animation + 400ms hold
- Between statement sequences: 400ms pause minimum
- Hold after key reveals: 800ms minimum
- Final frame: hold 2 seconds minimum
- PREMIUM = DELIBERATE. When in doubt, add more time.

### Strict Sequencing Rule

When one element is animating, NO other independent element should begin animation until first is FULLY COMPLETE and pause has passed.
- Animation A completes → 400ms pause → Animation B begins
- NEVER start drawing a new element while previous is still moving

## Part 9: Content Templates

### Quote Card (5-8s, loopable)
```
0-0.5s: Background gradient fades in
0.5-2s: Quote reveals word-by-word with kinetic typography
2-3.5s: Attribution slides in from below
3.5-5s: Brand watermark + CTA
```

### Protocol Breakdown (Carousel, 8-10 slides)
```
Slide 1: Hook - bold statement + protocol name + "Swipe"
Slides 2-8: One step per slide (number + name + icon + time + description)
Slide 9: Full protocol stack visualization
Slide 10: CTA - "Save this protocol" + brand
```

### Data Story (15-20s)
```
0-2s: Hook metric (big number, count-up, monospaced)
2-5s: Context ("Here's what happened over 30 days")
5-8s: Animated line chart drawing L-to-R
8-10s: Key data point highlighted with callout
10-13s: Comparison bar chart (before/after)
13-15s: Key insight card
15-18s: CTA + brand outro
```

### Before/After Transformation (5-8s)
```
0-0.5s: "Before" label
0.5-1.5s: Grainy, desaturated, scattered dashboard with low metrics
1.5-2.0s: Glitch/morph transition (maximum visual chaos)
2.0-3.0s: "After" resolves - clean, vibrant, high metrics
3.0-4.0s: Delta callouts ("+52 points", "+3.2 hrs deep sleep")
4.0-5.0s: Protocol name card + CTA
```

## Part 10: Quality Checklist

### Before Generating

- [ ] Is the prompt 50-100 words?
- [ ] One camera movement paired with one subject action?
- [ ] Specific lighting and color (not generic)?
- [ ] Lens specified (35mm, 85mm, etc.)?
- [ ] Duration appropriate for action?
- [ ] Style keywords included (cinematic, 4K, etc.)?

### After Generating

- [ ] Text readable at arm's length on mobile?
- [ ] Transitions at least 1000ms?
- [ ] No concurrent independent animations?
- [ ] Final frame holds 2+ seconds?
- [ ] Brand/CTA visible?
- [ ] No flickering or morphing artifacts?

### Do's

- Use monospaced fonts for ALL numbers/metrics/data
- Design for mute viewing first (text overlays critical)
- Use grain overlay (10-15% opacity) for texture
- Sequential line-by-line reveals for multi-line text
- Leave breathing room between animations (200-300ms minimum)

### Don'ts

- Never use emojis in professional content
- Never use bouncy spring animations (use mechanical, damped ease-out)
- Never let text move too fast to read (min 1s on screen)
- Never use light/thin font weights in motion
- Never skip the first-3-second hook
- Never use confetti/fireworks in data viz
