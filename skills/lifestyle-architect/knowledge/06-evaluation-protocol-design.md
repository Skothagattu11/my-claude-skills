**Capacity:** Medium (limited time, high responsibilities)

### Example 3: Low-Capacity Student in Recovery

**Capacity:** Low (depleted, fragile, rebuilding)

**8-Domain Evaluation:**

| Domain | Score | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| 1. Dharma & Purpose | 4 | Questioning everything; lost direction |
| 2. Physical Health | 4 | Sleep disrupted; not eating well; no exercise |
| 3. Mental & Emotional | 3 | In therapy; still struggling; some progress |

**Focus Areas:** Sleep (foundation), Mental/Emotional (with professional support), Behavioral Design (small wins)

**Protocol: "Gentle Rebuild"**

```
CORE PRINCIPLE: LESS IS MORE
- No ambitious goals
- Consistency over intensity
- Self-compassion always
- Therapy continues as foundation

DAILY NON-NEGOTIABLES:

Morning:
□ Wake at consistent time (even if tired)
□ Drink water
□ Step outside (even 2 min)
□ One small nourishing thing (shower, tea, gentle stretch)

Throughout day:
□ Eat 2 real meals (doesn't need to be perfect)
□ Take medications/supplements if prescribed
□ One small movement (walk to get coffee counts)

Evening:
□ Screens off by 9:30pm
□ Wind-down activity (not stimulating)
□ In bed by 10:30pm (even if not sleeping)

THAT'S IT FOR DAILY.
No meditation requirement (can increase anxiety when depleted).
No exercise requirement (movement only).
No productivity requirements.

WEEKLY NON-NEGOTIABLES:

□ One therapy session
□ One social contact (can be text, but ideally voice/in-person)
□ One "nice thing" for self (bath, nature, favorite food)
□ One gentle review: what went okay this week?

SCALING:

This IS the scaled-down version.
Stay here for at least 4-6 weeks.

Scale UP only when:
- Sleep is consistent for 2+ weeks
- Therapist agrees
- Energy is genuinely improving
- You WANT to add (not "should")

First additions (one at a time):
- 5 min gentle yoga OR walking
- Brief journaling
- Short meditation (with guidance, not silent)

WHAT TO TRACK:

- Sleep (hours and quality)
- Mood (simple 1-5)
- Did I do the basics?

NOT tracking:
- Productivity
- Exercise metrics
- Anything that creates pressure

IMPORTANT REMINDERS:

- Healing is not linear
- Bad days are not failure
- This is not about optimization
- You are allowed to rest
- Doing less can be doing more
```

## 6. Iteration and Review

### Weekly Review (15 min)

```
1. What went well this week?
2. What was difficult?
3. Did I hit my non-negotiables? (count)
4. What do I want to adjust?
5. Any scaling needed? (up or down)
```

### Monthly Review (30-60 min)

```
1. Complete 8-domain evaluation
2. Compare to last month
3. What moved? What didn't?
4. Is this protocol still appropriate?
5. Adjustments for next month
6. Celebrate progress (any amount)
```

### Quarterly Review (half day)

```
1. Full 8-domain evaluation with reflection
2. Review original goals
3. What have I learned?
4. Major life changes to account for?
5. Redesign protocol if needed
6. Set intentions for next quarter
```

## 7. Common Patterns and Anti-Patterns

### Design Patterns (DO)

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Anchor to existing** | New habits after established ones |
| **Start below capacity** | Leave 20-30% buffer |
| **Include recovery** | Planned lower-intensity periods |
| **Specify minimums** | Know the floor before you need it |
| **Front-load fundamentals** | Sleep, food, movement first |
| **Include community** | Social support from start |
| **Connect to meaning** | Link practices to purpose |
| **Review regularly** | Built-in reflection points |

### Anti-Patterns (DON'T)

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Too many changes** | Overwhelm, nothing sticks |
| **All-or-nothing** | One miss becomes total failure |
| **Copying others** | Their life isn't your life |
| **Ignoring capacity** | Burnout and backlash |
| **No flexibility** | Life happens; rigid breaks |
| **Outcome-only focus** | Process is more controllable |
| **Shame-based motivation** | Doesn't last; damages self |
| **Neglecting foundations** | Sleep, food, movement are base |

## Key Takeaways for Lifestyle Architects

1. **Evaluate comprehensively**: All 8 domains matter; imbalance eventually costs you.

2. **Design for capacity**: Match protocol to actual energy, not aspirational energy.

3. **Start with non-negotiables**: Know what must happen, not just what would be nice.

4. **Include minimums**: Design the crisis version before you need it.

5. **Scale intentionally**: Have clear triggers for scaling up and down.

6. **Review regularly**: Built-in reflection prevents drift.

7. **Iterate always**: Protocols evolve; don't treat them as fixed.

8. **Context matters**: Student ≠ Householder ≠ Elder. Customize.
