# Ayurvedic Lifestyle Design

## Knowledge Base Document 3/6

A practical reference for Ayurvedic daily and seasonal routines as lifestyle architecture.

---

## 1. Ayurveda Overview

### What is Ayurveda?

Ayurveda (āyur = life, veda = knowledge) is the traditional Indian system of medicine and lifestyle design, focusing on:
- Prevention over cure
- Individual constitution (prakṛti)
- Balance with environment and seasons
- Daily and seasonal routines as medicine

### Core Principle for Lifestyle Design

> "The secret of Ayurveda is not what herbs to take, but how to live."

Ayurveda provides detailed blueprints for:
- Daily routines (dinacharya)
- Seasonal routines (ritucharya)
- Life-stage protocols (āśrama-aligned)
- Individual customization (dosha-based)

## 2. The Three Doshas: A Simplified Framework

### Important Note

Dosha theory is complex and traditionally requires expert assessment. For lifestyle design purposes, we use a simplified framework focused on practical application, not medical diagnosis.

### The Three Doshas

| Dosha | Elements | Qualities | When Dominant |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Vāta** | Air + Space | Light, cold, dry, mobile, quick | Cold/dry seasons, late life, afternoon/night |
| **Pitta** | Fire + Water | Hot, sharp, intense, oily | Hot seasons, midlife, midday |
| **Kapha** | Earth + Water | Heavy, slow, cool, stable | Cold/wet seasons, early life, morning |

### Dosha and Time

**Daily Cycles:**
```
6am-10am:  Kapha time (heavy, slow) → Best for steady work
10am-2pm:  Pitta time (sharp, intense) → Best for challenging tasks
2pm-6pm:   Vāta time (light, mobile) → Creative, variable
6pm-10pm:  Kapha time → Winding down
10pm-2am:  Pitta time → Deep repair (should be sleeping)
2am-6am:   Vāta time → Light sleep, dreams, best to wake toward end
```

**Seasonal Cycles:**
```
Late Winter/Spring: Kapha accumulates → Lighten, activate
Summer: Pitta accumulates → Cool, moderate
Fall/Early Winter: Vāta accumulates → Ground, warm, nourish
```

**Life Stage Cycles:**
```
Childhood: Kapha dominant → Growth, building
Adulthood: Pitta dominant → Achievement, transformation
Elderhood: Vāta dominant → Wisdom, but needs grounding
```

### Practical Application

Rather than determining your "dosha type," use this framework to:
1. Understand why certain times/seasons feel different
2. Adjust practices to balance current conditions
3. Recognize signs of imbalance

## 3. Dinacharya: Daily Routine

### The Philosophy

Dinacharya (dina = day, charya = conduct) is the daily routine designed to:
- Align with natural circadian rhythms
- Maintain health through prevention
- Create stability and rhythm
- Build discipline (tapas) through consistency

### The Classical Dinacharya

#### Pre-Dawn (Brahma-muhūrta, ~4:30-6:00am)

**Wake up:** Ideally before sunrise, during brahma-muhūrta (the "creator's hour").

**Why this time?**
- Vāta quality supports spiritual practice
- Sattvic (pure) atmosphere
- Mind is fresh, uncluttered
- Aligns with natural light cycle

**Modern adaptation:** Wake at consistent time, as early as sustainable. Even 6am captures some benefit.

#### Morning Sequence (6:00-8:00am)

| Practice | Sanskrit | Purpose | Modern Version |
|----------|----------|---------|----------------|
| Elimination | Mala-tyāga | Clear bowels | Morning bathroom routine |
| Mouth care | Danta-dhāvana | Brush teeth | Brush, floss |
| Tongue scraping | Jihvā-nirlekhana | Remove toxins | Tongue scraper |
| Oil pulling | Gaṇḍūṣa | Oral health | Swish oil 5-20 min |
| Face/eye wash | Mukha-prakṣālana | Refresh, clear | Splash cold water |
| Nasal care | Nasya | Clear sinuses | Neti pot, nasal oil |
| Oil massage | Abhyaṅga | Nourish skin, calm nervous system | Self-massage with oil |
| Exercise | Vyāyāma | Move body | Yoga, walking, exercise |
| Bathing | Snāna | Cleanse body | Shower/bath |
| Meditation | Dhyāna | Settle mind | Meditation practice |
| Prayer/study | Pūjā/svādhyāya | Spiritual nourishment | Reading, practice |

#### Morning Meal (8:00-9:00am)

- Light to moderate breakfast
- Warm, cooked foods preferred
- Eat mindfully, seated

#### Midday (10:00am-2:00pm)

**This is Pitta time—digestive fire is strongest.**

- **Main meal** should be at midday (largest meal)
- Best time for demanding mental work
- Peak productivity window

**Meal guidelines:**
- Eat when hungry, not by clock alone
- Largest meal of the day
- Sit down, no screens
- Include all six tastes if possible

#### Afternoon (2:00-6:00pm)

**Vāta time—energy becomes variable.**

- Creative work
- Meetings, collaboration
- Light snack if needed
- Avoid heavy food

#### Evening (6:00-10:00pm)

**Kapha time—winding down.**

| Practice | Purpose | Modern Version |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Light dinner | Don't overload digestion | Eat light, finish by 7-8pm |
| Evening walk | Gentle movement | Walk after dinner |
| Family/social time | Connection | Quality time |
| Wind-down routine | Transition to rest | Reduce screens, dim lights |
| Self-reflection | Process the day | Journaling, gratitude |
| Sleep preparation | Quality sleep | Consistent bedtime routine |

**Sleep by 10pm:** Sleeping during Kapha time (before 10pm) is easier and more restful. After 10pm, Pitta rises and you may get a "second wind."

#### Night (10:00pm-6:00am)

- Deep sleep and restoration
- Pitta does repair work (10pm-2am)—must be asleep
- Vāta time (2am-6am)—lighter sleep, dreams

### Simplified Modern Dinacharya

**Minimum viable routine (30-45 min):**

```
MORNING (on waking):
□ Elimination
□ Tongue scrape + brush
□ Splash cold water on face
□ Glass of warm water
□ 10-15 min movement (yoga, walk, stretch)
□ 5-10 min meditation
□ Breakfast

MIDDAY:
□ Main meal
□ Brief walk after eating

EVENING:
□ Light dinner before 7pm
□ No screens after 8pm
□ Wind-down routine
□ In bed by 10pm
```

## 4. Ritucharya: Seasonal Routine

### The Philosophy

Ritucharya (ritu = season, charya = conduct) adapts lifestyle to seasonal changes, recognizing that:
- Each season has dominant qualities
- Ignoring seasons leads to disease
- Alignment with seasons is preventive medicine
- The body naturally shifts with seasons if we support it

### The Six Seasons (Indian Model)

| Season | Sanskrit | Months (approx) | Qualities | Dosha Effect |
|--------|----------|-----------------|-----------|--------------|
| Late Winter | Śiśira | Jan-Feb | Cold, dry | Kapha accumulating |
| Spring | Vasanta | Mar-Apr | Warming, wet | Kapha aggravated |
| Summer | Grīṣma | May-Jun | Hot, dry | Pitta accumulating |
| Monsoon | Varṣā | Jul-Aug | Wet, variable | Vāta aggravated |
| Autumn | Śarad | Sep-Oct | Cooling, dry | Pitta aggravated |
| Early Winter | Hemanta | Nov-Dec | Cold, moist | Vāta accumulating |

### Four-Season Model (Western Adaptation)

| Season | Dominant Qualities | Lifestyle Adjustments |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Winter** | Cold, dry, heavy | Warming foods, heavier meals, more rest, grounding practices |
| **Spring** | Wet, heavy, warming | Lighter foods, more movement, cleansing, stimulating practices |
| **Summer** | Hot, light, intense | Cooling foods, moderate exercise, rest in heat, calming practices |
| **Fall** | Dry, cool, variable | Nourishing foods, grounding routine, warming practices, oil |

### Seasonal Adjustments

#### Winter Protocol

**Qualities to balance:** Cold, dry, dark, heavy

| Domain | Winter Adjustment |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Food** | Heavier, warming, nourishing (soups, stews, grains, fats) |
| **Activity** | Can handle more intensity, build strength |
| **Sleep** | More sleep is natural, don't fight it |
| **Warmth** | Stay warm, avoid cold exposure |
| **Oil** | Regular self-massage with warming oils (sesame) |
| **Practice** | Grounding, building, warming |

#### Spring Protocol

**Qualities to balance:** Heavy, wet, sluggish (Kapha)

| Domain | Spring Adjustment |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Food** | Lighter, drier, spicier (greens, legumes, less fat) |
| **Activity** | Increase movement, sweat more |
| **Cleansing** | Good time for fasts, cleanses, decluttering |
| **Sleep** | Need less than winter, can rise earlier |
| **Stimulation** | Welcome more activity, social engagement |
| **Practice** | Activating, energizing, purifying |

#### Summer Protocol

**Qualities to balance:** Hot, sharp, intense (Pitta)

| Domain | Summer Adjustment |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Food** | Cooling, lighter (fruits, vegetables, less spice) |
| **Activity** | Moderate, avoid overheating, exercise early morning |
| **Rest** | Allow for more rest in peak heat |
| **Cooling** | Cool showers, swimming, shade |
| **Routine** | Can be more flexible than winter |
| **Practice** | Calming, cooling, spacious |

#### Fall Protocol

**Qualities to balance:** Dry, cool, variable (Vāta)

| Domain | Fall Adjustment |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Food** | Warm, moist, grounding (root vegetables, oils, cooked foods) |
| **Activity** | Steady, rhythmic, not erratic |
| **Routine** | Extra consistency needed—Vāta craves stability |
| **Oil** | Increase oil internally and externally |
| **Warmth** | Transition to warming practices |
| **Practice** | Grounding, stabilizing, nourishing |

### Ritucharya for Modern Life

**Quarterly review practice:**

At each seasonal transition:
1. Assess how you're feeling (signs of imbalance?)
2. Review your food, activity, sleep patterns
3. Adjust dinacharya for new season
4. Plan seasonal practices (cleanse, reset, adjust)

---

## 5. Balancing Principles

### The Key Rule

> When [quality] is high (in environment or body), reduce [that quality] through opposite practices.

| When This is High | Balance With |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Heat (pitta) | Cooling foods, calm activity, rest |
| Cold (vāta/kapha) | Warming foods, warming activity |
| Dryness (vāta) | Oil, moist foods, hydration |
| Heaviness (kapha) | Lighter foods, movement, stimulation |
| Mobility/anxiety (vāta) | Routine, grounding, stability |
| Intensity (pitta) | Relaxation, ease, moderation |

### Signs of Imbalance

**Vāta imbalance:**
- Anxiety, worry, fear
- Insomnia, light sleep
- Constipation, dry skin
- Feeling ungrounded, scattered
- Joint pain, cracking

**Pitta imbalance:**
- Irritability, anger
- Inflammation, skin issues
- Acid reflux, heartburn
- Overheating, sweating
- Perfectionism, criticism

**Kapha imbalance:**
- Lethargy, heaviness
- Depression, attachment
- Congestion, mucus
- Weight gain
- Resistance to change

## 6. Integration with Modern Science

### Circadian Alignment

Dinacharya aligns with circadian biology:

| Ayurvedic Concept | Circadian Science |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Wake before sunrise | Light exposure sets circadian clock |
| Main meal midday | Metabolism highest midday |
| Light dinner | Digestion slower at night |
| Sleep by 10pm | Melatonin rises, growth hormone peaks |
| Brahma-muhūrta practice | Cortisol rising, alert state |

### Seasonal Alignment

Ritucharya aligns with evolutionary biology:

| Ayurvedic Concept | Modern Understanding |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Winter nourishment | Body builds reserves |
| Spring lightening | Natural cleansing, allergy season |
| Summer cooling | Thermoregulation needs |
| Fall grounding | Preparation for winter |

### Research-Supported Practices

| Practice | Research Support |
|----------|-----------------|
| Tongue scraping | Reduces bacteria, improves taste |
| Oil pulling | Reduces oral bacteria, gingivitis |
| Self-massage | Reduces cortisol, improves circulation |
| Regular meal timing | Improves metabolic health |
| Early light exposure | Regulates circadian rhythm |
| Evening wind-down | Improves sleep quality |

## 7. Practical Implementation

### Starting Dinacharya

**Week 1:** Add one morning practice
- Tongue scraping OR warm water on waking

**Week 2:** Add wind-down routine
- Screens off by set time
- Consistent bedtime

**Week 3:** Add movement
- Morning yoga/walk/stretch (10-15 min)

**Week 4:** Add meditation
- Even 5 minutes counts

**Month 2:** Refine and expand
- Add practices gradually
- Adjust based on what's working

### Seasonal Transition Protocol

At each season change:

1. **Review** (Week before transition)
   - How did last season go?
   - What worked? What didn't?
   - Signs of imbalance?

2. **Plan** (Transition week)
   - What needs to change for new season?
   - Food adjustments?
   - Activity adjustments?
   - Practice adjustments?

3. **Implement** (First 2 weeks)
   - Make gradual changes
   - Notice effects

4. **Stabilize** (Rest of season)
   - Maintain new patterns
   - Fine-tune as needed

### Dinacharya Scorecard

Daily check (simple version):

```
Morning:
□ Woke at consistent time
□ Morning hygiene routine
□ Some movement
□ Some meditation/stillness

Midday:
□ Ate main meal mindfully

Evening:
□ Dinner before 8pm
□ Wind-down routine
□ In bed by target time

Score: __/8
```

## Key Takeaways for Lifestyle Architects

1. **Rhythm is medicine**: Consistent daily routine prevents disease better than any supplement.

2. **Time matters**: When you do things matters as much as what you do.

3. **Seasons are teachers**: Nature provides cues for how to live if we pay attention.

4. **Balance through opposites**: Counter environmental qualities with opposite practices.

5. **Morning sets the tone**: How you start the day creates momentum.

6. **Evening enables morning**: Good sleep comes from good wind-down.

7. **Individual variation exists**: Use these as frameworks, adapt to your needs.

8. **Start small**: One consistent practice beats elaborate inconsistent routines.
