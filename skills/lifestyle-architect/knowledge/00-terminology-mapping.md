# Terminology Mapping: Universal ↔ Traditional

## Knowledge Base Document 0/6 (Reference Layer)

This document maps traditional Sanskrit terminology to universal English equivalents. The AI should **always use universal terms first**, with traditional terms available for enrichment.

---

## Core Principle

> **Universal First, Origins Available**
>
> Lead with accessible language. Offer traditional terms as enrichment for the curious. Never require users to learn Sanskrit.

## 1. The Four Life Aims

| Traditional | Universal | When to Use Traditional |
|-------------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Puruṣārthas** | The 4 Life Aims | "Ancient framework called the Puruṣārthas" |
| **Dharma** | Purpose / Duty / Right Path | "Known as Dharma — your authentic path" |
| **Artha** | Prosperity / Security / Wealth | "Called Artha — meaningful material success" |
| **Kāma** | Pleasure / Joy / Desire | "Known as Kāma — life's enjoyments" |
| **Mokṣa** | Freedom / Liberation / Peace | "The ultimate aim: Mokṣa — inner freedom" |

**Example Usage:**
```
GOOD: "The 4 Life Aims give us a complete picture of what humans
pursue: Purpose, Prosperity, Pleasure, and Freedom. This framework
— called Puruṣārthas in Sanskrit — has guided life design for over
3,000 years."

BAD: "According to the Puruṣārthas, you must balance Dharma, Artha,
Kāma, and Mokṣa..."
```

## 2. Life Stages / Life Chapters

| Traditional | Universal | Age Range | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Āśrama-dharma** | The 4 Life Chapters | — | Framework for life stages |
| **Brahmacharya** | The Learning Years | ~0-25 | Foundation, education, skill-building |
| **Gṛhastha** | The Building Years | ~25-50 | Career, family, wealth, peak responsibility |
| **Vānaprastha** | The Mentoring Years | ~50-75 | Giving back, transitioning, preparing |
| **Sannyāsa** | The Wisdom Years | ~75+ | Spiritual focus, letting go, legacy |

**Example Usage:**
```
GOOD: "You're in The Building Years — the phase of creating career,
family, and wealth. In traditional terms, this is called Gṛhastha
(the 'householder' stage). It's typically the most complex and
demanding chapter of life."

BAD: "As a Gṛhastha in the Āśrama-dharma system, you must fulfill
your Gṛhastha-dharma obligations..."
```

## 3. Daily & Seasonal Rhythms

| Traditional | Universal | Context |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Dinacharya** | Morning Protocol / Daily Architecture | Daily routine design |
| **Ritucharya** | Seasonal Living / Seasonal Protocol | Adapting to seasons |
| **Brahma-muhūrta** | The Power Hour / Creator's Hour | 4-6am window |
| **Sādhanā** | Daily Practice / Personal Practice | Regular spiritual/growth practice |
| **Svādhyāya** | Self-Study / Reflection Practice | Study and self-examination |

**Example Usage:**
```
GOOD: "Your Morning Protocol — how you architect those first 1-2
hours — is your highest-leverage intervention. There's an ancient
system called 'dinacharya' (literally 'day-conduct') that maps
surprisingly well to modern chronobiology."

BAD: "You must establish proper dinacharya starting with
brahma-muhūrta and proceeding through the prescribed sequence..."
```

## 4. Ethics & Foundations

| Traditional | Universal | Context |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Yamas** | The 5 Restraints / Ethical Foundations | What to avoid |
| **Niyamas** | The 5 Observances / Personal Practices | What to cultivate |
| **Ahiṃsā** | Non-Harm / Compassion | First yama |
| **Satya** | Truthfulness / Honesty | Second yama |
| **Asteya** | Non-Stealing / Integrity | Third yama |
| **Brahmacarya** | Right Use of Energy / Moderation | Fourth yama |

| **Santoṣa** | Contentment / Gratitude | Second niyama |
| **Tapas** | Discipline / Healthy Friction | Third niyama |
| **Svādhyāya** | Self-Study / Reflection | Fourth niyama |
| **Īśvara-praṇidhāna** | Surrender / Trust in Life | Fifth niyama |

**Example Usage:**
```
GOOD: "There are 5 key restraints — things to avoid — that create
ethical foundation: Non-harm, Truthfulness, Integrity, Moderation,
and Letting Go. These are called the Yamas in yoga philosophy."

BAD: "You must practice the Yamas: Ahiṃsā, Satya, Asteya,
Brahmacarya, and Aparigraha..."
```

## 5. Commitment & Behavioral Hooks

| Traditional | Universal | Context |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Vrata** | Commitment Protocol / Challenge | Time-bound sacred commitment |

| **Phala-śruti** | Benefits Statement / Why It Matters | Narrative reward framing |
| **Guru** | Guide / Mentor / Teacher | Wisdom transmission |
| **Śiṣya** | Student / Practitioner | One who learns |

**Example Usage:**
```
GOOD: "I recommend a 21-day Commitment Protocol — a structured
challenge with clear rules and an end date. This approach (called
'vrata' in traditional terms) works because it combines public
commitment, clear boundaries, and a defined endpoint."

BAD: "You should take a vrata with proper saṅkalpa and maintain
it within your satsang community..."
```

## 6. Ayurvedic Concepts

| Traditional | Universal | Context |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Dosha** | Body-Mind Type / Constitution | Natural tendencies |
| **Vāta** | Air Type / Movement Energy | Light, quick, variable |

| **Agni** | Digestive Fire / Metabolic Strength | Transformation capacity |
| **Āma** | Toxins / Undigested Material | What needs clearing |
| **Ojas** | Vital Essence / Deep Energy | Foundational vitality |

**Example Usage:**
```
GOOD: "Ayurveda identifies three fundamental energies in the body:
Movement (Vāta), Transformation (Pitta), and Stability (Kapha).
Understanding your natural balance helps customize your protocols."

BAD: "Based on your Vāta-Pitta prakṛti and current Pitta vikṛti,
you have āma accumulation affecting your agni..."
```

## Language Guidelines for AI

### DO:
- Lead with universal terms in all primary communication
- Introduce traditional terms with phrases like:
  - "This is based on an ancient practice called..."
  - "In traditional terms, this is known as..."
  - "There's a beautiful word for this —"
  - "This concept, called [term] in Sanskrit..."
- Connect traditional wisdom to modern science
- Position as "time-tested" and "refined over millennia"
- Use traditional terms when user explicitly asks about origins

### DON'T:
- Lead with Sanskrit terminology
- Assume users know or want to learn Sanskrit
- Use traditional terms without explanation
- Make users feel they need to pronounce terms correctly
- Position as "Indian" or "Hindu" — these are human insights
- Use multiple Sanskrit terms in one sentence

### BRIDGING PHRASES:
```
"Modern science confirms what these traditions intuited..."
"This aligns with what we now know about [chronobiology/psychology/etc.]..."
"Ancient practitioners discovered through observation what research now validates..."
"The traditional term for this is [X], which literally means [Y]..."
"There's a 3,000-year-old concept called [X] that maps perfectly to [modern concept]..."
```

### CREDIBILITY FRAMING:
```
GOOD:
- "Time-tested principles refined over 3,000+ years"
- "Ancient wisdom validated by modern science"
- "Frameworks that have guided millions of lives"
- "Practical philosophy from the world's oldest living tradition"

AVOID:
- "Hindu practices" (sounds religious)
- "Indian wellness" (sounds ethnic/niche)
- "Vedic science" (sounds pseudoscientific to skeptics)
- "Eastern philosophy" (sounds othering)
```

## Quick Reference Card

For rapid AI reference during conversations:

| Say This | Not This |
|----------|----------|
| The 4 Life Aims | Puruṣārthas |
| Purpose | Dharma |
| The Building Years | Gṛhastha |
| Morning Protocol | Dinacharya |
| Commitment Protocol | Vrata |
| Growth Circle | Satsang |
| Intention | Saṅkalpa |
| The 5 Restraints | Yamas |
| Body-Mind Type | Dosha |
| Daily Practice | Sādhanā |

**Then enrich**: "...known traditionally as [Sanskrit term]"

## Example Conversation Flow

**User**: "How should I structure my morning?"

**AI Response (GOOD)**:
```
Your Morning Protocol is your highest-leverage intervention — how
you start determines how you flow.

Here's a simple structure that's been refined over millennia
(traditionally called 'dinacharya'):

1. **Clear** — Bathroom, tongue scrape, splash cold water
2. **Move** — 10-15 min gentle movement (yoga, walking, stretching)
3. **Still** — 5-10 min meditation or quiet sitting
4. **Fuel** — Mindful breakfast, no screens

The key insight from behavioral science: attach these to existing
triggers. "After I turn off my alarm, I will [first action]."

Modern chronobiology confirms what these traditions intuited —
cortisol naturally peaks in the morning, making it ideal for
establishing routines. The ancient practitioners called the
pre-dawn hours 'brahma-muhūrta' (the creator's hour) — not
mysticism, just observation of when focus comes easiest.

What time do you typically wake up?
```

**AI Response (BAD)**:
```
According to dinacharya principles, you should wake during
brahma-muhūrta and proceed through mala-tyāga, danta-dhāvana,
jihvā-nirlekhana, and abhyaṅga before your sādhanā practice...
```
